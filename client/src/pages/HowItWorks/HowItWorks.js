      The idea of this tool is to help out everyone from a DIY enthusiast to a
      fencing contractor. Just enter the linear footage, the height and the
      style of fence you're looking for and this tool will generate a realtime
      pricing list from a home depot near you. You can then make a copy of that
      list and send it to the home depot pro desk and for an extra $75, they'll
      deliver everything right to your front door. Sometimes they even waive the
      delivery fee if your project is quite large... and you're nice. If there
      any problems with this tool then please feel free to hit the contact me
      button or email me directly at: bengilpin@icloud.com. Made with love and
      proudly Canadian.
